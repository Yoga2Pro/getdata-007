The analysis file uses your default work directory to store input and output files by default. You may define the work directory based on your need.

The analysis file downloads the input file as well as "plyr" library automatically, do the analysis as requested in the project, and output the tidy data to "output" folder under work directory.

The analysis file contains all comments on each step.
